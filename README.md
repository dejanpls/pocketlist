# PocketList

A React experiment

This is a rewrite of a simple JavaScript app I originally built with Vanilla JS.
I've learned React basics and wanted to see how far I can take the same idea while learning new patterns.

### What it does

- Lets you add, remove, and keep track of items (like a pocket-sized to-do/shopping list).
- Saves everything to **LocalStorage**, so your list sticks around even after a refresh.

### Why I built it

I wanted to practice:

- Moving vanilla JS logic into React components.
- Working with React state, props and hooks.
- Using LocalStorage in a React-friendly way.

And because:

- All other todo apps are not for me.
- I needed a super simple app to track my shopping list.

### Tech stack

- **React (Vite setup)**
- **LocalStorage**
